# Marksheet-generator-In-C-
A simple C++ console-based project that generates a student marksheet. The program takes marks of 5 subjects as input, calculates total marks, percentage, and grade, and then saves the result in a text file (marksheet.txt) for record keeping. It helps beginners understand the use of basic input/output, conditionals, and file handling in C++.
